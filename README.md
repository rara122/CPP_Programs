Shortestpaths
=============

Algorithms Project for Calculating Shortest Path! 

This Project will implement Dijkstra's algorithm on a graph using a Priority Queue.
The Implementation will accept the source node and the description of the graph in a file.
The Format of the file is the same as the Stanford Web Graph. 
The output of the program will be written to a file "out.txt".
The sample output will be like the following...
 >Dijkstra
 >Source: S
 >Node S: 0
 >Node 1: 7
 >Node 2: 4
 >Node ...: ...
 >Node n: 2
 >End Dijkstra
